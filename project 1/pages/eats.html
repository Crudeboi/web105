      When I offer to cook for someone, I always make sure to put all of my
      attentnion and care into anything I'm serving. Even if someone doesn't
      know you and you cook them a wonderful dish, they'll already have some
      type of respect for you because they judged you on an extension of
      yourself physically presented in front of them. I taste, therefore I cook.

      When I was just a young man with no hair on my chest, I would come home
      after school and watch Anthony Bourdain's "No Reservation". I never heard
      of this man before, or knew that he was a chef coming out of NYC.

      But after watching him try everything there is to eat, and talking with
      the locals about origins on the local dishes, I looked at food
      differently. He had this punk-rock, New York attitude about him that stood
      against establishment but saw peace in food and cooking. He is no longer
      with us
