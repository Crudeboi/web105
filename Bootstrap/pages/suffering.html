<h2>
  The suffering will always hold a special place in my heart. I never bought the game.  I didn't have $59.99 as a child. So my dad would
  rent it for me from the local video store. When those were a thing at least. I bought the game guide for "The Suffering" and it was the first timele
  I ever did for any game.  For those who don't know, game guides let you get every little bit from the game. From hidden amo to secret
  locations you probably wouldn't have been able to find on your own.  I would stay up late making sure I squeezed every single bit of this game. It was the first linear
  story I ever finished.  I played many games before this, but "The Suffering" solidified my interest in gaming forever.
