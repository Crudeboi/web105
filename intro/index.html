<h1>My First Site</h1>
<h2>I am taking WEB 105 at Mchenry County College</h2>
<p>Everyone I talk to in cyber security says the best place to start is in help desk.
    It's interesting to see how a webpage works behind the scenes.
    I hope to learn more about computers than I already do.
<h3>Kristian's hobbies</h3>
<p>Spending money,
    Gambling,
    Working.
