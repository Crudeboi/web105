    <h2>Gets candy</h2>
    <p>
      yo sometimes i get candy sometimes i don't. what can a guy do but that's
      all i can do is complain and who is going to listen anyway here's your
      candy please don't egg my house. it took along time last year to scrape
      off the yoke why don't you go and egg that person's house? they don't even
      put up halloween decoration's it's not like i'm against their beliefs or
      anything but halloween is for the kids. if you're not going to give out
      candy, at least turn all your lights off or something.
